        <p>
          My name’s <strong>Geoffrey D. Metzger</strong> — developer, dad, and founder of <em>Integrity Programming</em>. 
          I built this site, <strong>Coffee + Kids + Code</strong>, as a way to document the grind of balancing family life, tech ambitions, and the mission to build tools that actually help people.
        </p>

        <p>
          By day, I’m a community-driven developer working on education tech under the <a href="https://theshandaapp.com" target="_blank">Open Doors Academy</a> and <em>SHANDA</em> initiatives — programs that help students in underserved schools learn math, tech, and career skills through AI-powered tools. 
          By night, I’m usually coding with a cup of coffee while my kids are asleep, turning ideas into working software.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started this blog to keep things real — not to chase trends or buzzwords, but to share what it’s actually like to juggle projects, parenting, and purpose. 
          The posts here cover everything from late-night debugging to leadership lessons from the school community, all written straight from the source.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Build</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Open Doors Academy</strong> – an educational platform helping students learn through interactive tutoring and quizzes.</li>
          <li><strong>Integrity Programming</strong> – the home base for my projects, freelance work, and mission-driven code.</li>
          <li><strong>Coffee + Kids + Code</strong> – this blog: the journal of it all.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I Believe</h2>
        <p>
          Integrity isn’t a feature — it’s the foundation. That’s true for code, business, and life. 
          I believe tech should empower people, not replace them. And I build every project with that mindset: practical, human-centered, and driven by real-world impact.
        </p>

        <h2>Let’s Connect</h2>
        <p>
          Whether you’re another developer, a parent balancing life and learning, or someone trying to break into tech — I’m always open to talk.
