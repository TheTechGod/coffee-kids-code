      <section class="post-body">
        <p>This week, I wrapped up the front-end build for <strong>Coffee + Kids + Code</strong>. It’s live, responsive, and ready for the next phase. 
        But the real win wasn’t shipping the site—it was realizing that <em>consistent, focused progress each day</em> adds up faster than any 10-hour grind session ever could.</p>

        <h3>1) The Power of Momentum</h3>
        <p>Every night this week, I carved out just an hour or two after work. Some days it was small—fixing a mobile layout bug, optimizing spacing, polishing a tag bar. 
        Other nights, I pushed a full section. By the end of the week, all those small pushes stacked up into something that felt massive: a finished, polished front end that’s production-ready.</p>

        <p>Momentum is the secret sauce. It’s not about intensity; it’s about rhythm. When I touch code daily, even in small doses, I stay connected to the project’s pulse. 
        I don’t need to re-learn context or rebuild motivation. It becomes muscle memory.</p>

        <h3>2) The Life Parallel</h3>
        <p>Programming mirrors life here. Whether it’s parenting, fitness, studying for AWS, or just keeping the house in order—the same truth applies: 
        <strong>small, consistent effort beats heroic bursts of energy.</strong></p>

        <p>You can’t out-sprint inconsistency. You can, however, outlast it.</p>

        <h3>3) Finishing the Front-End MVP</h3>
        <p>From the first HTML tag to the last CSS tweak, the site now feels real. It’s not just a prototype—it’s the public face of what’s coming next. 
        The foundation is set for the backend, blog expansion, and integration with bigger projects like SHANDA.</p>

        <p>Each component—responsive navbar, scrollable tag bar, gradient fade, share button—was a single day’s mission. 
        None of them were huge. But strung together, they became the week’s success story.</p>

        <h3>4) Applying This Forward</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>In code:</strong> Build daily, even for 30 minutes. Don’t lose the thread.</li>
          <li><strong>In life:</strong> Handle one task at a time. Consistency compounds.</li>
          <li><strong>In mindset:</strong> Celebrate every small win—they’re the foundation of mastery.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Finishing this blog’s front end wasn’t just a coding milestone—it was proof that progress doesn’t need to be loud to be powerful. 
        It just needs to keep showing up.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>So here’s to small, steady steps—the kind that build confidence, create systems, and eventually, move mountains.</p>
