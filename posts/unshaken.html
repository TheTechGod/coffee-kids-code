          The other day Kelan and I were talking about something—I don’t even remember what it was—but I said, “You know what kid, I wouldn’t worry about it.” 
          He looked at me and said, “Yeah, well you don’t worry about anything.”
        </p>

        <p>
          That hit me. Not in the way you’d expect, but in a quiet, proud way. Because despite everything going on behind the scenes—working full-time, chasing a job in my field, dealing with ‘extended family’ noise over custody, and carrying a few battles I don’t talk about—none of that weight has leaked onto my kids.

          That’s what being a parent really is. It’s not about perfection or pretending life’s easy. It’s about making sure your kids feel steady even when you’re standing in a storm. They can know things are happening, but they shouldn’t feel the stress of it. They should still get to be kids—secure in the idea that whatever’s happening, you’ve got it handled.

          And I do. It’ll all work out. It always does.
