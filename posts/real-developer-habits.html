        <p>
          Every once in a while you come across a list of “rules” that isn’t blowing smoke or trying to sound mystical. These hit different because they’re the habits that actually shape you into a sharper developer — the kind who writes code he can trust three months later.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Clear naming</h2>
        <p>
          This alone will save your sanity. Nobody wants to revisit a file called <em>data_final_FINAL_v3_realfinal.js</em>. Clean naming makes every project lighter — SHANDA, ODA, the AWS Trainer, your blog, all of it. Your future self will thank you.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Learn the tools you use every day</h2>
        <p>
          If VS Code is your second home, act like it. Shortcuts, multi-cursor editing, built-in refactors, Git integration — this stuff makes you faster instantly. When you’re bouncing between five modules, it matters.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Honest commit messages</h2>
        <p>
          This is the grown-man version of leaving a note for yourself. Simple, direct commit messages are a gift — to future you, to recruiters, to collaborators. Your GitHub already looks cleaner because of it.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Leave clues when needed</h2>
        <p>
          We’d all love perfectly self-explanatory code, but real projects get messy. A short, sharp comment around a tricky block of logic keeps you from reverse-engineering your own brain later.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Reread your old code</h2>
        <p>
          This is where growth hides. Every time you review the AWS Trainer, the blog, or the Math Mini-App, you spot patterns, trim fat, and fix things you didn’t even know you were doing wrong. That’s the craft leveling up.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Share what you learn</h2>
        <p>
          Teaching forces clarity. Writing posts, dropping notes, explaining a concept — it cements things. And let’s be honest: it fits your brand. You build, then you tell the story behind it.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Protect your focus</h2>
        <p>
          With kids, job apps, AWS studying, SHANDA dev, freelance work, and a portfolio to polish — your focus is currency. When you lock in, you get more done in twenty minutes than most do in two hours.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Leveling up takes time</h2>
        <p>
          This is the long game. The daily AWS quiz. The 20-minute Mini-App sessions. Cleaning your Git flow. Updating the blog. Compounding wins turn into real skill.
        </p>

        <h2>The bottom line</h2>
        <p>
          These aren’t motivational quotes. They’re the foundation. The real work. And they line up perfectly with the developer you’re already becoming.
